# Coffee_House
We needed to Create an app that with two interfaces. One interface for a  cashier to enter the customer's name and their order. The order will then be in the barista queue that the baristas and give them the ability to mark an order complete. Once marked complete, the order should move to a list of completed orders with the barista's name who completed the order next to it. The cashier and baristas should have completely different views. Bonus points if the app automatically says the customer's name out loud when an order is complete.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, EJS, MongoDb


## Lessons Learned:

- How to create a server with Express
- How to manage a database with MongoDB
- How to use Node modules

## Optimizations

The code pushed is not complete and is missing a few features. It is missing the ability for the barista to mark a complete order, name of the barista that completed the order. The bonus points are missing as well
